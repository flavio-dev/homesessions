            ... are a series of events designed to make a connection between a music selector,
            a visual artist & a small audience.
            <br />
            no booth, no phones, no physical barriers.<br />
            h/s aims to rebuild the bond between interaction & communication, music & people, art & accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            no live streams, no requests, no pressure. just freedom & mind openers.<br />
            freedom for the selector to play whatever they feel like, for however long they want.<br />
            opportunity for the artist to share his/her art expression directly with the audience.<br />
            this results in a unique journey, between impromptu cross art form collaborations & free flow,
            in the intimacy of a berlin flat.
