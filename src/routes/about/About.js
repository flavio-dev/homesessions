            ... are a series of events designed to make a connection between a music selector & a small audience.
            <br />
            no booth, no phones, no physical barriers.<br />
            h/s aims to rebuild the bond between interaction & communication, music & people.
          </p>
          <p>
            no live streams, no requests. just freedom.<br />
            freedom for the selector to play whatever they feel like, for however long they want - no pressure.<br />
            let the music tell the story.
